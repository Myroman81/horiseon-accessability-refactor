# horiseon-accessability-refactor

##This challenge was vital in developing the skills learned in week one of the coursework.  It also provided an example of how technology is constantly changing and needs to be updated on a regular basis to serve it's clientele; in this case, people with disabilities.  As technology advances and creates products and services for more people, companies must adjust accordingly.  In this case, the website needed updating as it wasn't accessible to people with disabilties who use assistive technologies.  Video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards are relatively new and if a companies website isn't updated to be compatible with these new technologies the site will be viewed by less people overall.
